# Hi there! 👋 I'm Hamza Khalid Chouhdary

Aspiring to transform ideas into elegant and efficient digital solutions, I'm a passionate software engineer with a focus on web development. Currently, I'm thrilled to be a part of the team at **[CareAxiom] (aka CareMerge)**, where I contribute my expertise to create cutting-edge solutions. My expertise spans a range of technologies, including **NodeJs**, **ReactJs**, **AngularJs**, **Ruby on Rails** (RoR), and **PHP**. With a blend of creativity and technical acumen, I thrive on crafting user-centric applications that deliver seamless experiences.

## What I Do

- 🚀 **Full-stack Development**: I'm well-versed in building dynamic and responsive web applications, both on the frontend and backend. My toolkit includes the power of **ReactJs**, **AngularJs**, and **NodeJs**, allowing me to create performant and engaging user interfaces while ensuring robust server-side functionality.
  
- 🧪 **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: I'm a firm believer in writing tests before the code. With TDD, I ensure that my applications are not only functional but also maintainable and reliable. Writing tests from the outset provides a safety net for future changes and enhancements.

- 🌟 **User-Centric Design**: I believe that great software starts with a deep understanding of users' needs. I take pride in creating intuitive and visually appealing UIs that enhance user satisfaction and usability.

- 🛠️ **Versatile Skills**: From the flexibility of **ReactJs** to the convention-over-configuration philosophy of **Ruby on Rails**, I've got experience working with diverse frameworks and languages. Whether it's crafting APIs, optimizing database queries, or designing complex front-end architectures, I've got it covered.

- 📚 **Lifelong Learner**: The tech landscape is ever-evolving, and I thrive on keeping up with the latest trends and tools. This ensures that my solutions are not only current but also poised to adapt and scale.
