# Hi there! 👋 I'm Hamza Khalid Chouhdary

I am a dedicated full-stack engineer specializing in developing SaaS applications. From building a robust and performant API to a user-friendly UI, I took charge of everything. My experience stretches various technologies, including **NodeJs**, **RoR**, **PHP**, **ReactJs**, and **AngularJs**. With a blend of creativity, technical expertise, and strong analytical and problem-solving skills, I thrive on building user-centric microservice applications that deliver seamless user experiences and meet business needs. My agility, excellent teamwork, and communication abilities strengthen me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.

## What I Do

- 🚀 **Full-stack Development**: I'm well-versed in building dynamic and responsive web applications, following clean code practices, both the frontend and backend. My toolkit includes the power of **ReactJs**, **AngularJs**, and **NodeJs**, allowing me to create attractive and engaging interfaces and robust server-side development.

- 🧪 **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: I firmly believe in writing tests before the code. With TDD, I ensure that my applications are functional but also testable and reliable. Writing tests from the outset provides a safety net for future changes and enhancements.

- 🌟 **User-Centric Design**: I believe that great software starts with a deep understanding of users' needs. I take pride in creating intuitive and visually appealing UIs that enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

- 🛠️ **Versatile Skills**: From the flexibility of **NodeJs** to the convention-over-configuration philosophy of **Ruby on Rails**, I've got experience working with diverse frameworks and languages. Whether it's writing APIs, optimizing database queries, or designing complex user interfaces, I've got it covered.

- ⚙️ **Analytical and Problem-Solving Skills**: My strong analytical skills enable me to dissect complex challenges and find innovative solutions. I thrive in troubleshooting and resolving intricate technical issues, ensuring smooth problem resolution.

- 🤝 **Team Collaboration**: Effective teamwork is essential for successful projects. I excel in collaborating with cross-functional teams, sharing ideas, and contributing to a positive and productive work environment.

- 📢 **Communication**: Clear communication is key in any project. I'm skilled at translating technical concepts into accessible language for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- 📚 **Lifelong Learner**: The tech landscape is ever-evolving, and I thrive on keeping up with the latest trends and tools. This ensures that my solutions are not only stable but also composed to adapt and scale.
